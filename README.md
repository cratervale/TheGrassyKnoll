###About
I made this simple web toy in 2010 as an experiment with transparent png backgrounds, jQuery animation, and en/de-queuing performance in the DOM.

Today, CSS3 animations have replaced the need for javascript to handle the cloud animations.  I did a simple refactor to take advantage of CSS3 background image layering, but have left the rest of the code from 2010 intact.
